delete me when finished :)

"git clone <url>": download the repo from the web to your computer. 
  - make sure you're not in another repo!!!
  - only one per repo


##branches

"created a new branch" 
git switch <branch name>: to work on that branch



##deleting branches

when finished with a pull and merge, you can delete the branch. github prompts you, but there is still additional cleanup needed after that. 

fetch --prune is helpful to remove deleted branches from the log to make it easier to see previous changes.
